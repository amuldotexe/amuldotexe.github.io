Hypothesis:
Few of us learn to laugh at our mistakes

I mean, unless the mistake caused someone severe hurt, there's no use being bitter with yourself

even for a couple of seconds

isn't it?

how does it help?

let's laugh a little when we make some mistakes next time

as we inevitably will

observe don't judge
