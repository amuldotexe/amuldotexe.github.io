I do not intend to structure this page

this is lovely as a chaos

what I really seek here is to utulize the copilot to help me write random things on a markdown page

Eventually this will be moved to my Secret Compendium

I am going to optimize for flow rather than structure

The key task is stil about slowing down time by focusing on the breath

I bow down to my maker and pray for more ideas to come to me

I trust my mind to think of the right ideas which will help my problem solving

Just had some tea

It was immersive

So what should I do now?

Let us classify some problems into Important and Urgent buckets

# I am going to use the Eisenhower Matrix

1. Important and Urgent
2. Important and Not Urgent
3. Not Important and Urgent
4. Not Important and Not Urgent
5. What has to be done today
6. What has to be done tomorrow
