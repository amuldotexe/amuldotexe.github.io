I do not intend to structure this page

this is lovely as a chaos

iykwim

what I really seek here is to utulize the copilot to help me write random things on a markdown page

Eventually this will be moved to my Secret Compendium

I am going to optimize for flow rather than structure

The key task is stil about slowing down time by focusing on the breath

I bow down to my maker and pray for more ideas to come to me

I trust my mind to think of the right ideas which will help my problem solving

Just had some tea

It was immersive

So what should I do now?

Let us classify some problems into Important and Urgent buckets

# I am going to use the Eisenhower Matrix

1. Important and Urgent
2. Important and Not Urgent
3. Not Important and Urgent
4. Not Important and Not Urgent
