Hypothesis:
Believing that you deserve something is often helpful

imagine this amazing girl who is very pretty

you are sitting with her

you've been thinking about her for a long time, and now you have an organic chance to speak to her

just imagine this situation

the stakes feel high

the heart races

now, how coherent you are while talking to her or how thoughtful you are during that conversation really depends on whether you think you deserve to be talking to her or not

pause here:
It is about whether you think you deserve to talk to her or not

what is your belief?
if you think she's out of my league, then you will fumble because in your mind, she's out of your league.

your mind will feel unnecessary uneasiness in speaking to her

the more you feel the difference between you & her

the more likely you will fumble

pause for 30 secs
re-read the above ☝️☝️

how many opportunities in life have you messed up because of this pattern

it has probably happened to all of us
a lot many times

now, apply this same pattern to your job interviews

if you are extremely desperate for a job and feel like if you make it to this job, it will be a dream come true, even though it seems out of your league, what will happen?

your desperation will make you fumble & your problem solving capabilities will be reduced

your % problem solved at interview (numerator) divide by the % solved in an interview (denominator), this number will go down if you think that you don’t deserve that particular job

you will get into this zone:
this job is out of my league, I don't deserve it

and the moment you tell your mind that → your mind will trigger a self-fulfilling prophecy

our mind can often go
into the mode of
living up to the expectations
of what this human thinks of it

re-read the above ☝️☝️

our mind tries to be consistent with our expectations of its performance

this means that when we think "I don't deserve this job," it can trigger self-sabotaging actions

thus, you are unable to think clearly & start fumbling around

you sabotage your own performance in the interview or in front of the girl

reflect for 30 seconds here

see if you can find such patterns in your own past

Role of Written Affirmations
--

such beliefs are subconscious in nature

hence likely our solution also lies in the domain of the subconscious

a good way to reprogram such beliefs is written affirmations

if, supposedly, I'm giving an interview at Gojek for an SDE role, then I will write down "I deserve to be an SDE at Gojek" around 30 times for 7-8 days

the moment you write it, the mind starts playing this game that says, "Nah, no, you don't deserve it."

but soon, your mind will start accepting it subconsciously because you will provide your mind with affirmations of solid tangible reasons for why you deserve it

E.g.
I deserve to be an SDE at Gojek because I have spent 150 hours mastering DSA concepts & use them well

note 1 for affirmations:
You shouldn't be a perfectionist during this exercise. That is, don't say "I need to reach this level to be in Gojek."

tell yourself: I am adequately equipped for this job

the important word is to avoid perfectionism & the word "adequate" is key

you should just be adequate enough and get the job done; you don't have to be amazing or a perfectionist

adequacy is achievable for most jobs, my friend

the difference between adequacy & perfectionism can be large, so be aware of your perfectionist inclination

Note 2 for affirmations:
deserving to be an SDE versus becoming an SDE are two different things. You can deserve it, but still not make it due to varied interview circumstances

that's why we say "I deserve to be", since we can't predict the future

give your mind something it can believe

avoid using "will" in your affirmation; instead, use "deserve"

also, be specific about the position & company, so the belief feels more real

emphasis on:
feels real
finally, this is a lot like a badminton match

you will keep on giving your affirmations, those 4-5 solid tangible reasons (Proof of Work), to your mind repeatedly for first 30 iterations

your mind will keep on attacking back saying, "No, no you don't deserve it"

next, for the iterations 31-70, tone of the mind will change to maybe, maybe, maybe you do deserve it after all this work

don't stop the affirmations right now

then, after you present these facts again and again to your mind, your subconscious mind will finally be able to accept that yes, you do deserve to be an SDE at Gojek after roughly 70 iterations

so from iterations 71-100, you will solidify a "Yes" in your mind

thus, now during the Gojek interview, your mind will be like, "Yeah, I deserve to be an SDE at Gojek," and the person interviewing me is like a peer, so I can have a usual conversation with him/her

you feel way more calmer & you feel much less desperate

now that you feel comfortable having a conversation with the interviewer

you can now effortlessly be yourself and perform closer to your potential

pause on this moment
where nothing feels like a dream
but merely a possibility which you deserve

do you see the difference

you being comfortable around interviewer is extremely helpful from an interviewer's perspective

when we feel uncomfortable in the presence of another person, we send those vibes and that person becomes uncomfortable

nervous candidates make interviewers nervous too

if you exude confidence and comfort, the interviewer themselves will calm down and feel more engaged in the interview

this helps both of you have a more graceful conversation, regardless of the results of the interview

both playing to their full potential

it also helps with your first impression

for example, when you have a candidate who comes in and is comfortable with you right away, you subconsciously form an opinion that they must be a reasonable candidate

why do you feel that they must be a decent candidate?

because they are so comfortable in their own skin, which is not as common as you'd think

so the first impression is already sorted, now you just need to live up to this expectation via your problem solving

self-esteem, or the feeling of "I deserve," is an important component of maintaining composure in high-stress performance scenarios such as interviews or dating

you are likely to perform better if you feel that you already deserve a positive outcome

reflect on this a bit

Caveats:
I could be wrong
Context is everything
No silver bullet
YMMV
