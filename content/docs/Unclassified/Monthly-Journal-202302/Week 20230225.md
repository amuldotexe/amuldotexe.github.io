### List of solved questions

- How can we get an extension which can make copy pasting images
Well we found one but its pretty new just giving it a spin here. We tried to paste a file in it but the biggest issue is that it is not able to resize the image. The name of the current one is Markdown Editor nu zaaack. We will try to find a better one.
Other options are: Markdown All in One (it is not wysiwyg) & StackEdit (image resizing not solved)

I think I did good today
I explored a lot of things
Github copilot is definitely helpful
Anyways I am going to sleep now

Dear Mind,
We did good today
Thank you for your efforts & ingenuity

It is fun to pair with you

In hindsight, I should probably keep all assets in Miro Boards which are public & link them to github via a URL in the markdown file

Just an idea

May be we should continue writing in text
Images are not that important

This
right here
what I have
is enough ...
