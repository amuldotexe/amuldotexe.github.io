### List of solved questions

- How can we get an extension which can make copy pasting images
  Well we found one but its pretty new just giving it a spin here. We tried to paste a file in it but the biggest issue is that it is not able to resize the image. The name of the current one is Markdown Editor nu zaaack. We will try to find a better one.
  Other options are: Markdown All in One (it is not wysiwyg) & StackEdit (image resizing not solved)

## How Albus will think on meta level

### Hypothesis

#### Meditation, Twitter & Productivity

May be when you meditate a lot, you don't feel like tweeting

### Be a project of your girl cousins

If you are Jain boy unable to find a girl for yourself

make really good friends with your cousins of opposite gender

once they start trusting you, they will inevitably try to make you their project

they will try to pair you up with their cousins or their friends

girls want to settle with someone they trust

a lot of trust is merely familiarity

you can get your familiarity points by being friends with their cousins

you don't even have to do anything to impress them anymore

your cousins will evangelize your candidature to your target segment

### 25 Feb 2023

I think I did good today
I explored a lot of things
Github copilot is definitely helpful
Anyways I am going to sleep now

Dear Mind,

We did good today

Thank you for your efforts & ingenuity

It is fun to pair with you

In hindsight, I should probably keep all assets in Miro Boards which are public & link them to github via a URL in the markdown file

Just an idea

May be we should continue writing in text
Images are not that important

This
right here
what I have
is enough ...

Let us first clear out our head.

Things to do today :

- Important & Urgent
  - Check finances. All the accounts & assimilate them into a google sheet
    - Decide on the next steps for the SIPs
  - Affirmations
    - to start the day
    - every 3 hours
  - Cross-fit workout + Inclination walking
  - Physiotherapy sessions
- Important but Not Urgent
  - SOPs for daily activities
    - Eating & Drinking
    - Cleaning the body
-
