Grateful for a pre 7 am tea

for jimjam & little hearts

for a moment of pause
before the calendar takes control of our day 

for a moment of contemplation
before consumption takes us into its fold

for the opportunity to steal these moments
from our own life
when the world doesn't demand our attention yet

This
right here
what I have
is enough ...
