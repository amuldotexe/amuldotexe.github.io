Hi

I am amuldotexe

Have been working in tech since 2010

Currently working in a product role at a large US based company

If you have come here to read my playbook, you can find it in the link below

<a href=
"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OtquLlhW9JDDJDpvQBf-NTzvKH2s8PaGnXW087KlG10/edit?usp=sharing"> playbook of amuldotexe </a>>


This playbook has been primarily put together by me as a guide for myself and the like-minded folks I collaborate with, providing a reference for my hypotheses & bookmarks I've gathered over the last couple of years

The playbook is a living document and will be updated as I evolve further

It is simply a google document which can be exported to epub or pdf as per your need

Feel free to copy, distribute, plagiarize, share screenshots or do whatever you want with it, without asking me for permission

Also, you don't need to attribute me or anything

I am just a practitioner, sharing what works for him, in the hope of attracting folks who think in similar patterns

So in case you vibe with what I wrote, I'd like to hear about it
